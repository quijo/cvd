        <h1>District Superintendent Report</h1>

        <p>
            All glory, honor and praises is to our Almighty God. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            To our Presiding officer for this 40th District Assembly, DS Rev. Cryz Colorado, good morning, Sir. Our District leaders, Pastors, Local Church Leaders, delegates and guests, a pleasant morning to all. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Before I will proceed to my content allow me to start with this verse from the Bible, “How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity! For there the LORD bestows his blessing, even life forevermore. (Ps. 133:1,3b).
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            The first and second quarter of the fiscal year of 2021-2022 is quite difficult for us as a district and for me personally. After the strict restrictions from the government due to covid 19 we were hit by a devastating typhoon named “Odette.” We celebrated Christmas and New Year primitively, without electricity and water supply and it lasts for more than a month. Yet, we survived it at least more than a month of uncomfortable and unfavorable situation with limited supply. We learned to adjust. In addition, right after our clean up drive in our church due to typhoon Odette my health deteriorated. I almost went to the Lord the fact that I could not breathed properly. My oxygen level is extremely. I was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. I almost die. However, our God is gracious and merciful, He sustained and healed me totally. The reason maybe why God extended my life is because of my family. My kids are still young. God really listens to my wife’s prayer. Furthermore, I have work to finish.
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Today, my heart is overjoyed and full of thanksgiving. First, to our Loving God, Abba Father for He delivered me from the pit of death. Second, to my beautiful wife and children who really stays along the way of my difficult journey. Your presence, prayers and petitions are beyond measure. To my wife and daughters, I love you very much. I am here always for you. Third, to my local church and local church board in Inayawan Church of the Nazarene, I am blessed to have you. You really boost my morale during our lowest moment. You are one of the reasons that I didn’t give up in life. Fourth, to my co-leaders in Central Visayas District thank you so much. You made our journey enjoyable and productive. Lastly, to all who prayed for me thank you so much. May our good God bless and keep you always.
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Now, let me share to you what God has put in my heart concerning our district. Central Visayas District is strategically located in terms of ministry opportunities. We have so much resources and potentials that could bring us to a higher level of ministry and church growth if maximize properly. Now, it is unto us to open our eyes to see and integrate these potentials and resources into a more productive ministry. We all desire church growth, isn’t it? In fact, we envy those who succeed in their ministry. Yes, we do serve the same God but, why are they growing exponentially? Maybe it is high time for us to learn this principle, “Don’t just work hard instead, work smart.” If we don’t have the wisdom how to maximize properly our resources then, church growth will not happen. It is difficult to bury a nail with screw drivers. Prayer for church growth is one thing but, it is not the main thing. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Our district leadership is working seriously in finding pieces of puzzles that is lacking for our local churches to grow. If we cannot connect the enormous gap from here to there then, church growth will not come. I believe many of us are trying to build the bridge but, some of us doesn’t know how to build it. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Our district is quite old. In fact, we are now on our 40th year assembly. However, our statistics doesn’t match the years of our existence as a denomination. I can testify that our pastors sacrificed their time, energy and money for the sake of ministry. Some are forced to leaved homes and families without food because of ministry. In fact, many of our pastors today are literally living by faith. Receiving less than a thousand pesos every Sunday. Some endure and still in the battle field but, some leaved their comrades in the middle of the fight. We need to act on this perennial problem in our district. Let us unite because we are in one district, one family in the Lord. Let us not hold back the things that we think will really help the body. 
        </p><br/>
        <p>
            In behalf of the district leadership, we, envisioned that for the next 3 to 5 years if God will allow and grant our desire that all local churches in our district that exist today will become a self sustaining church that could fairly support the need of the assigned pastor. This entails that any unproductive system must be replace with something productive to ensure a satisfactory growth in our local churches. We will be looking forward that every minister be equip with the right tools in every particular job. We need to innovate so that we will not be left behind of this fast changing society. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            These are the things we want to achieve in our district and local churches in the next 3 to 5 years. In no particular order.
        </p><br/>

        <ul>
            <li>Fully equip and innovative pastors and ministers</li>
            <li>Healthy church that is able to mother a daughter church</li>
            <li>Financial stability</li>
            <li>Active participation of members in disciple making</li>
            <li>Investment for the next generation leaders</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The district will strengthen the educational arm through our Ministerial Studies Board in partnership with the PhilMicTEEN. Trainings and seminars are soon become a regular event in our district.  
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            In connection of our drive for synchronicity the district through our secretariat and treasury department will provide a unified template for the role of members and financial recording to be downloaded to all local churches before the end of the first quarter of this fiscal year. All pastors, local church secretaries and treasurers are required to attend the orientation and training. The details will be announced later. 
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            Let us dream big for our churches. Break the spirit of procrastination and mediocrity. Let us strive for excellence for this is what God expected from us. Remember the exhortation of our brother Paul in Philippians 4:8, “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.” If we want to rise up and soar high from here to there it should start now because tomorrow may not come.
        </p><br/>

        <p>
            In Christ,
        </p><br/>

        <p>
